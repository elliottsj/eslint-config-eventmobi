#### What ticket is this for?
*The PR is associated with a ticket that has defined acceptance criteria. Tickets are important as they give us all visibility into the work being done and its status and value.*

[EA-](https://eventmobi.atlassian.net/browse/EA-)

#### What do we need to know to understand these changes?
*Why are we making this change? This should include important information the submitter needed to figure out before starting the work - design specs & any other planning documents, diagrams, other relevant systems, previous changes, etc.*

#### What does this PR do?
*This is a summary of the technical changes. PRs should be clear and focused.*

#### How can we manually test your changes?
*Even if the reviewer doesn't manually test the changes this sets out the expected behaviour and the reviewer can use this knowledge to judge if there are proper automated tests in place.*

#### Are there any blockers to merging this ticket?
*Backwards incompatible changes should be minimized if at all possible, if this change includes backwards incompatible changes, what are they and why are they necessary? Are there any dependancies that need to be deployed before this ticket is merged? Are there any special steps that need to be taken upon this PR being merged or deployed?*

#### What are you not sure of?
*Worries should be explicit. If the submitter is worried that this might break something, or if they don't understand something in what they've changed that should be out in the open. Include anything you're not sure about here.*
